<p>Army veteran turned cryptocurrency cybercrime investigator in an industry that desperately lacked methodology and personnel focused on fighting fraud.
<p>He holds certifates such as Harvard Business School Extension CORe, Certified Bitcoin Professional, Chainalysis Reactor Certified, and Certified Blockchain and Law Professional -- but what is more relevant is he is "writing the book" for training that is relevant to what he does, as such training doesn't yet exist.

<p>He is seen as a subject-matter expert by the FBI (and numerous other law enforcement/regulatory agencies) and at the “top of the Rolodex” for Special Agents who have questions concerning blockchain-related cybercrime.
<p>Richard prides himself on a very strong working relationship with the FBI and sees the opportunity to help law enforcement and the government with this new technology as a blessing.

<p>He was the lead investigator for dozens of cryptocurrency scams and hacks, most notably a SIM swapping ring with many arrests in 2018.
